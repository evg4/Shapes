## Project Title
Shapes
## Description
The main reason for building this was to practise importing and exporting functions in JavaScript and spinning up a local server to test the site as I built it. The pages use basic JavaScript functions to rotate shapes and change their colour at random when they are clicked. I have set this up with an initial index page then two other pages so I could keep the modules to be imported separate from my other files.
## Features
The shapes change to a random colour and rotate when they are clicked.
## How to use
